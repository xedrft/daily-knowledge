**EXAMPLE 1 - Physics Format Template:**
Input: "Thermodynamic Cost of Quantum Measurements", Difficulty: 12
Output:
{
  "content": "The study of quantum measurement processes reveals a fundamental connection between information theory and thermodynamics. **Quantum measurements** involve the irreversible collapse of a quantum superposition \\\\(|\\\\psi\\\\rangle = \\\\sum_i c_i |i\\\\rangle\\\\) to a definite eigenstate \\\\(|j\\\\rangle\\\\) with probability \\\\(|c_j|^2\\\\). This collapse process necessarily involves interaction with a measurement apparatus and subsequent information processing.\\n\\n**Landauer's principle** establishes that any irreversible information processing operation requires a minimum energy dissipation of \\\\(k_B T \\\\ln 2\\\\) per bit erased, where \\\\(k_B = 1.381 \\\\times 10^{-23} \\\\text{ J/K}\\\\) is Boltzmann's constant and \\\\(T\\\\) is the reservoir temperature. For quantum measurements, this cost arises from the need to record measurement outcomes in classical memory devices.\\n\\nThe total thermodynamic cost involves both the measurement interaction and information storage. The minimum work required can be expressed as: \\\\[W_{\\\\text{min}} = \\\\Delta F_{\\\\text{system}} + k_B T S_{\\\\text{info}}\\\\] where \\\\(\\\\Delta F_{\\\\text{system}}\\\\) represents the free energy change of the quantum system and \\\\(S_{\\\\text{info}}\\\\) quantifies the entropy of the measurement record. This relationship demonstrates how quantum mechanics and statistical thermodynamics are fundamentally linked through the concept of information.",

      "solution": "According to **Landauer's principle**, the minimum energy required is: \\\\[Q_{min} = k_B T \\\\ln 2\\\\] Substituting the values: \\\\[Q_{min} = (1.38 \\\\times 10^{-23} \\\\text{ J/K})(300 \\\\text{ K})(\\\\ln 2) = 2.87 \\\\times 10^{-21} \\\\text{ J}\\\\] This represents the fundamental thermodynamic cost of information processing."

**EXAMPLE 2 - Advanced Math Concept:**
Input: "Fourier Series Convergence", Difficulty: 10
Output:
{
  "content": "**Fourier series** provide a powerful method for representing periodic functions as infinite sums of sine and cosine terms. The convergence properties of these series are fundamental to understanding their applications in physics, engineering, and mathematics. For a function \\\\(f(x)\\\\) with period \\\\(2\\\\pi\\\\), the Fourier series is given by: \\\\[f(x) = \\\\frac{a_0}{2} + \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} [a_n \\\\cos(nx) + b_n \\\\sin(nx)]\\\\]\\n\\nThe **convergence** of Fourier series depends on the smoothness and continuity properties of the function. **Dirichlet's theorem** states that if a function is piecewise continuous and has a finite number of discontinuities and local extrema in any period, then its Fourier series converges pointwise to the function at points of continuity, and to the average of left and right limits at discontinuities.\\n\\n**Uniform convergence** occurs when the function is continuous and its derivative is piecewise continuous. In such cases, the Fourier series converges uniformly to the function, allowing term-by-term integration and differentiation. The **Gibbs phenomenon** describes the peculiar behavior near discontinuities where the partial sums overshoot by approximately 9% of the jump discontinuity.",

      "answer": "\\\\(f(x) = \\\\frac{4}{\\\\pi} \\\\sum_{n=1,3,5,...}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\sin(nx)}{n}\\\\)",
      "solution": "Since the function is odd, \\\\(a_n = 0\\\\) for all \\\\(n\\\\). For the sine coefficients: \\\\[b_n = \\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} \\\\int_0^{\\\\pi} 1 \\\\cdot \\\\sin(nx) dx = \\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1-\\\\cos(n\\\\pi)}{n}\\\\] This gives \\\\(b_n = \\\\frac{4}{n\\\\pi}\\\\) for odd \\\\(n\\\\) and \\\\(b_n = 0\\\\) for even \\\\(n\\\\)."
