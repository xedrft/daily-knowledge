### EXAMPLES (Few-Shot Learning)

**EXAMPLE 1 - Physics with Subtle Engagement:**
Input: "Thermodynamic Cost of Quantum Measurements", Difficulty: 12
Output:
{
  "content": "Consider a fundamental question that bridges quantum mechanics and thermodynamics: what is the true cost of acquiring information about a quantum system? **Quantum measurements** represent more than passive observations‚Äîthey are active processes that inevitably disturb the system being studied and require a thermodynamic price.\\n\\nWhen a quantum system exists in a superposition of states, a measurement forces it to collapse into a definite outcome. This **collapse postulate** implies that the measurement apparatus must interact with the quantum system in an irreversible way. The interaction becomes thermodynamically significant because it connects the abstract concept of information with concrete physical quantities like energy and entropy.\\n\\n**Landauer's principle** provides the crucial insight: erasing one bit of information necessarily dissipates at least \\\\(k_B T \\\\ln 2\\\\) of energy as heat, where \\\\(k_B\\\\) is Boltzmann's constant and \\\\(T\\\\) is the temperature. This fundamental limit applies to any measurement process that must store or erase information about the quantum state. The minimal thermodynamic cost \\\\(W_{min}\\\\) for a measurement can be expressed as: \\\\[W_{min} \\\\geq \\\\Delta F - k_B T I\\\\] where \\\\(\\\\Delta F\\\\) represents the change in free energy and \\\\(I\\\\) quantifies the information gained. This relationship reveals the deep connection between information theory and the laws of thermodynamics.",
  "problemset": [
    {
      "problem": "Calculate the minimum energy dissipation required to erase one bit of information at room temperature (T = 300 K) according to Landauer's principle.",
      "answer": "\\\\(2.87 \\\\times 10^{-21}\\\\) joules",
      "solution": "According to **Landauer's principle**, the minimum energy required is: \\\\[Q_{min} = k_B T \\\\ln 2\\\\] Substituting the values: \\\\[Q_{min} = (1.38 \\\\times 10^{-23} \\\\text{ J/K})(300 \\\\text{ K})(\\\\ln 2) = 2.87 \\\\times 10^{-21} \\\\text{ J}\\\\] This represents the fundamental thermodynamic cost of information processing."

**EXAMPLE 2 - Advanced Math Concept:**
Input: "Fourier Series Convergence", Difficulty: 10
Output:
{
  "content": "**Fourier series** provide a powerful method for representing periodic functions as infinite sums of sine and cosine terms. The convergence properties of these series are fundamental to understanding their applications in physics, engineering, and mathematics. For a function \\\\(f(x)\\\\) with period \\\\(2\\\\pi\\\\), the Fourier series is given by: \\\\[f(x) = \\\\frac{a_0}{2} + \\\\sum_{n=1}^{\\\\infty} [a_n \\\\cos(nx) + b_n \\\\sin(nx)]\\\\]\\n\\nThe **convergence** of Fourier series depends on the smoothness and continuity properties of the function. **Dirichlet's theorem** states that if a function is piecewise continuous and has a finite number of discontinuities and local extrema in any period, then its Fourier series converges pointwise to the function at points of continuity, and to the average of left and right limits at discontinuities.\\n\\n**Uniform convergence** occurs when the function is continuous and its derivative is piecewise continuous. In such cases, the Fourier series converges uniformly to the function, allowing term-by-term integration and differentiation. The **Gibbs phenomenon** describes the peculiar behavior near discontinuities where the partial sums overshoot by approximately 9% of the jump discontinuity.",
  "problemset": [
    {
      "problem": "Find the Fourier series for the square wave function \\\\(f(x) = 1\\\\) for \\\\(0 < x < \\\\pi\\\\) and \\\\(f(x) = -1\\\\) for \\\\(-\\\\pi < x < 0\\\\), with period \\\\(2\\\\pi\\\\).",
      "answer": "\\\\(f(x) = \\\\frac{4}{\\\\pi} \\\\sum_{n=1,3,5,...}^{\\\\infty} \\\\frac{\\\\sin(nx)}{n}\\\\)",
      "solution": "Since the function is odd, \\\\(a_n = 0\\\\) for all \\\\(n\\\\). For the sine coefficients: \\\\[b_n = \\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} \\\\int_0^{\\\\pi} 1 \\\\cdot \\\\sin(nx) dx = \\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1-\\\\cos(n\\\\pi)}{n}\\\\] This gives \\\\(b_n = \\\\frac{4}{n\\\\pi}\\\\) for odd \\\\(n\\\\) and \\\\(b_n = 0\\\\) for even \\\\(n\\\\)."
